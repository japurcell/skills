## Repository maintenance

8. [ ] Set an acceptable maximum feedback runtime for `.github/workflows/hooks-posix.yml`, then refactor the workflow to meet it while preserving required coverage; some runs currently take nearly 30 minutes.


## Investigations


2. [ ] Investigate a pre-commit hook that runs all tests and checks Markdown syntax and local links. Select existing Markdown/link tooling, and assess changed-file scoping and feedback runtime against the original full-test requirement before proposing a narrower alternative.


4. [ ] Define one bounded prototype for configurable agent workflows, multi-harness routing, live/history inspection, and evidence-based self-improvement.

Supporting content lives in `brain/plans/software-factory`.


7. [ ] Reproduce scanner capacity/recovery behavior on current code before considering budget changes; historical incomplete-scan incidents are not current defect proof. [codebase/secret-scanner](codebase/secret-scanner.md)



17. [ ] Clean up skills: remove `addy-*` skills and assess minimal bespoke replacements to reduce context usage.

18. [ ] Incorporate relevant brain principles into code review skills.

19. [ ] Pull in the unslop skill from [poteto/noodle](https://github.com/poteto/noodle/tree/main/.agents/skills/unslop).


23. [ ] Investigate Cursor’s formal verification skill: [create-formal-verification-skill](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/blob/main/pstack/skills/create-formal-verification-skill/SKILL.md).
