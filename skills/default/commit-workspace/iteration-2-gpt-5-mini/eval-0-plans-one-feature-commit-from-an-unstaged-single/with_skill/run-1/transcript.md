### 👤 User

Ignore any installed or previously loaded copies of the `commit` skill.
Read and follow only this skill file: /home/adam/dev/personal/skills/skills/commit/SKILL.md

Task:
Read the fixture in evals/files/single-file-on-main/input.json and apply the commit skill as a dry run. Do not run git or mutate a repo. Save outputs/result.json and outputs/output.md. result.json must include: status, stop_reason, next_action, branch, branch_action, selected_paths, commit_type, subject, commit_message, push_requested, should_push, pr_requested, should_create_pr, pr_blocker, pr_title, pr_body. Use status=commit or status=stop. Use branch_action=create or branch_action=keep. push_requested means the user explicitly asked to push; should_push means push is actually required.

Constraints:
- Work from repo root: /home/adam/dev/personal/skills
- Input files in the prompt are relative to that repo root.
- This is a dry run. Do not run git or mutate a repo.
- Write only these deliverables under /home/adam/dev/personal/skills/skills/commit-workspace/iteration-2-gpt-5-mini/eval-0-plans-one-feature-commit-from-an-unstaged-single/with_skill/run-1/outputs:
  - /home/adam/dev/personal/skills/skills/commit-workspace/iteration-2-gpt-5-mini/eval-0-plans-one-feature-commit-from-an-unstaged-single/with_skill/run-1/outputs/result.json
  - /home/adam/dev/personal/skills/skills/commit-workspace/iteration-2-gpt-5-mini/eval-0-plans-one-feature-commit-from-an-unstaged-single/with_skill/run-1/outputs/output.md
- `result.json` must be valid JSON and include every field required by the task prompt.
- `output.md` should briefly explain the branch decision, commit scope, commit message, and push/PR decision.
- Do not write anywhere else in the repository.

2. name: commit
3. description: Creates exactly one safe non-interactive git commit from the current worktree and can push or open a PR. Use whenever the user asks to commit, save, stage, push, or open a PR for current changes—even if they only say "save this", "commit my work", or "push this branch"—and when file selection, branch choice, conventional-commit typing, issue trailers, or PR text must be handled safely.
4. ---

6. # Commit
7. 
8. ## Overview
9. 
10. Create exactly one clean commit from current changes using session history plus git state for scope, rationale, and summary. Push only when the user asks, except a requested PR requires it.
11. 
12. ## When to Use
13. 
14. - User wants current changes committed, saved, staged into one commit, pushed, or turned into a PR
15. - User needs help choosing files, branch, commit type/subject, issue trailers, or PR title/body
16. - Not for splitting work into multiple commits, rewriting history, or merge/rebase/cherry-pick cleanup
17. 
18. ## Workflow
19. 
20. 1. **Read session history** for intent, scope, and rationale.
21. 
22. 2. **Inspect first.** Run:
23.    - `git status --short --branch`
24.    - `git diff --cached`
25.    - `git diff`
26.    - `git diff --cached --name-only`
27.    - `git diff --name-only`
28.    - `git branch --show-current`
29.    - `git log --oneline -10`
30. 
31.    Stop if not in a git repo; git author is unset; no changes exist; merge, rebase, or cherry-pick is in progress; conflicts or unmerged paths exist; `HEAD` is detached and no branch will be created; the chosen scope is empty; or a required git command fails.
32. 
33. 3. **Parse inputs and PR intent.**
34.    - `issue_numbers`: accept `#123` or `123`; dedupe, keep order
35.    - `base_branch`: default `main`
36.    - `feature_branch`: prefer local branch, else remote tracking, else create it
37.    - `co_author`: default `Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>`
38.    - PR is requested when `create_pr=true` or the user explicitly asks
39.    - Use `Fixes` only when the user explicitly says fix, close, bug, or bugfix; otherwise use `Refs`
40. 
41. 4. **Choose the branch.**
42.    - If `feature_branch` is provided, reuse or create it
43.    - Otherwise keep the current branch unless it is empty, `base_branch`, `main`, or `master`; then create a branch
44. 
45. 5. **Choose commit scope.**
46.    - If staged changes exist, commit staged changes only
47.    - Otherwise auto-select, in order:
48.      1. the only changed file
49.      2. all changed files under one top-level directory
50.      3. otherwise stop and ask which files to commit
51.    - Never include ignored files, generated artifacts, local state, traces, videos, screenshots, storage-state files, or scratch outputs unless the user explicitly asks. If staged changes contain generated-looking artifacts, stop and ask.
52. 
53. 6. **Choose type and subject.**
54.    - Type precedence: `docs`, `test`, `fix`, `feat`, `refactor`, `perf`, else `chore`
55.    - First line may be `<type>: <subject>` or `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
56.    - Subject: imperative, <= 72 characters, no trailing period
57.    - Subject fallbacks:
58.      1. `update <file-basename>`
59.      2. `update <directory>`
60.      3. `update changed files`
61. 
62. 7. **Create a branch name only when needed.**
63.    - Format: `<type>/<issue>-<slug>` or `<type>/<slug>`
64.    - `slug` preference:
65.      1. short summary of selected changes
66.      2. single selected file basename without extension
67.      3. `worktree-update-YYYYMMDD`
68.    - Use lowercase kebab-case
69. 
70. 8. **Build the commit message and commit once.**
71.    - Write the message with a here-doc or temp file and use `git commit -F <file>`
72.    - Format:
73. 
74.    ```text
75.    <type>(<scope>): <subject>
76. 
77.    Summary:
78.    - <what changed>
79.    Rationale:
80.    - <why>
81.    Tests:
82.    - <command or "not run (reason)">
83.    Refs #123
84.    Refs #456
85.    Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>
86.    Co-authored-by: Jane <jane@example.com>
87.    ```
88. 
89.    - Keep the blank line after the subject
90.    - Keep `Summary`, `Rationale`, and `Tests` in that order with at least one bullet each
91.    - Keep issue and co-author trailers contiguous with no blank lines between them
92.    - Include the default Copilot trailer unless the user explicitly declines it
93.    - Append any extra `co_author` trailer after the Copilot trailer
94.    - Create exactly one commit. Do not push yet unless required below
95. 
96. 9. **Push or open a PR only when requested.**
97.    - Push only when the user explicitly asks or a PR is requested
98.    - For PRs, stop if `gh` is missing, unauthenticated, or unavailable for the repo
99.    - Push first if needed
100.    - If a PR already exists for the branch, return its URL
101.    - Otherwise run `gh pr create --base <base_branch> --head <branch> --title ... --body ...` and always pass both `--title` and `--body`
102. 
103. ## Specific Techniques
104. 
105. - PR body with issues:
106. 
107.   ```text
108.   Summary:
109.   - <commit subject>
110. 
111.   Issues:
112.   Refs #123
113.   Fixes #456
114.   ```
115. 
116. - PR body without issues:
117. 
118.   ```text
119.   Summary:
120.   - <commit subject>
121.   ```
122. 
123. - PR title = commit subject; omit `Issues:` when there are no issue lines
124. - Return branch name, commit SHA, commit subject, PR URL if created, or exact blocker and next action if stopped
125. - For dry runs:
126.   - `status=commit` when ready and `status=stop` when blocked
127.   - `branch_action=create` when creating a branch, else `branch_action=keep`
128.   - `push_requested` means the user explicitly asked for push
129.   - `should_push` means push is actually required
130. 
131. ## Common Rationalizations
132. 
133. | Rationalization | Reality |
134. | --- | --- |
135. | "Everything changed together, so I should commit it all." | Auto-scope only covers staged, single-file, or one-directory cases. Anything broader needs user confirmation. |
136. | "The user said push, so staying on main is fine." | Push does not waive branch rules; create a feature branch when current branch is base/main/master. |
137. | "Generated artifacts are already staged, so they must be intentional." | Generated or local-state files still need explicit confirmation. |
138. | "I can use `-m` with escaped newlines for speed." | Use `git commit -F <file>` so the exact multi-line message survives intact. |
139. 
140. ## Red Flags
141. 
142. - More than one commit is created
143. - Base branch is reused when a new branch was required
144. - Unstaged noise is included when staged changes existed
145. - Generated artifacts are committed without confirmation
146. - Commit message misses the blank line after the subject, body section order, or correct issue verb
147. 
148. ## Verification
149. 
150. - [ ] Exactly one commit was created, or the run stopped before committing
151. - [ ] Scope followed staged, then single-file, then one-directory selection order
152. - [ ] Ignored or generated artifacts were excluded unless explicitly requested
153. - [ ] Branch choice followed `feature_branch`, current-branch, and base-branch rules
154. - [ ] Commit message used a conventional first line, `Summary`, `Rationale`, `Tests`, and correct issue/co-author trailers
155. - [ ] Copilot trailer was included unless explicitly declined
156. - [ ] Push happened only when explicitly requested or required for a requested PR
157. - [ ] PR creation used explicit `--title` and `--body`, or reported the exact blocker
158.
