### 👤 User

Read and follow the build skill from this exact path: /home/adam/dev/personal/skills/skills/build-review-workspace/skill-snapshot-iteration-8/SKILL.md
Ignore any other installed copies of the build skill.
Answer the user's task using that workflow.

Task:
An implementer comes back with `NEEDS_CONTEXT` and says: 'I have not explored the repo yet. Please read the relevant files and tell me the solution before I start.' Using the build workflow, how should the manager respond?

5. 
6. # Build
7. 
8. ## Core Loop
9. 
10. 1. Invoke the `addy-context-engineering` and `subagent-model-selection` skills.
11. 2. Pick the next pending task from the plan.
12. 3. If the task is ambiguous, conflicts with the plan, or the human wants tradeoff analysis first, do not dispatch yet. Resolve that first.
13. 4. Otherwise dispatch immediately with the [implementer-prompt.md](./implementer-prompt.md) template and a lean handoff:
14.    - task text and success criteria
15.    - known constraints and validation commands
16.    - only already-known file hints
17. 5. Do **not** pre-read large file sets, draft the solution, or sketch likely patches before dispatch.
18. 6. The implementer owns repo discovery, pattern lookup, first-pass design, code changes, and verification.
19. 7. After the implementer returns `DONE`, dispatch the [simplifier-prompt.md](./simplifier-prompt.md) with:
20.    - the files the implementer touched
21.    - the implementer's verification context
22.    - all uncommitted files from `git status --porcelain`, excluding deleted files and `.gitignore` files
23. 8. After the code-simplifier returns `DONE`, dispatch the [code-reviewer-prompt.md](./code-reviewer-prompt.md) with:
24.    - the touched files
25.    - the current verification context
26.    - all uncommitted files from `git status --porcelain`, excluding deleted files and `.gitignore` files
27. 9. Update tracking only after the final reviewer returns `DONE`, using <update-tracking-instructions>.
28. 
29. ## Manager Guardrails
30. 
31. - Dispatch as soon as the task is clear enough to execute.
32. - Pass through only information already known from the plan, task, or repo rules.
33. - Ordinary repo exploration, pattern lookup, and first-pass design stay with the implementer.
34. - Ordinary repo exploration is not a valid `NEEDS_CONTEXT`.
35. - If the implementer asks the manager to explore the repo or hand over a solution, push that work back to the implementer.
36. 
37. ## Verification Selection
38. 
39. - Verification ownership stays with the implementer.
40. - Infer the task's surface and stack before choosing validation.
41. - Prefer the narrowest matching checks for that stack. For shell or Python work, use shell or Python validation instead of generic frontend commands unless the task is actually frontend work.
42. 
43. <update-tracking-instructions>
44. 1. Update the plan and todo tracker immediately.
45. 2. Record the verification actually performed.
46. 3. Mark the task `done` in the tracker.
47. </update-tracking-instructions>
48. 
49. ## Shared Escalation Rules
50. 
51. - **NEEDS_CONTEXT:** Provide the missing requirements, missing constraints, or conflicting-signal context and re-dispatch. Routine discovery is not a valid `NEEDS_CONTEXT`.
52. - **BLOCKED:** Assess the blocker:
53.   1. If it's a context problem, provide more context and re-dispatch with the same model.
54.   2. If the task requires more reasoning, re-dispatch with a more capable model.
55.   3. If the task is too large, break it into smaller pieces.
56.   4. If the plan itself is wrong, escalate to the human.
57. 
58. ## Subagent Status Handling
59. 
60. ### Implementer
61. 
62. - **DONE:** Proceed to code-simplifier.
63. - **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS:** Read the concerns before any downstream step or tracking update. If they raise a correctness concern or scope concern, address them first, usually by re-dispatching an implementer. Do not update tracking yet.
64. - **NEEDS_CONTEXT:** Ordinary repo exploration and pattern lookup stay with the implementer; only missing requirements, missing constraints, or conflicting signals qualify.
65. - **BLOCKED:** Follow the shared escalation rules.
66. 
67. ### Code-Simplifier
68. 
69. - **DONE:** Proceed to code-reviewer.
70. - **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS:** Read the concerns before continuing to code-reviewer. If they raise a correctness concern or scope concern, treat them as unresolved work, address them first, usually by re-dispatching the subagent that should own the fix, and do not update tracking yet.
71. - **NEEDS_CONTEXT:** Provide the missing context and re-dispatch.
72. - **BLOCKED:** Follow the shared escalation rules.
73. 
74. ### Code-Reviewer
75. 
76. - **DONE:** Proceed to update tracking.
77. - **DONE_WITH_FINDINGS:** Address findings before updating tracking. Re-dispatch the subagent that should own the fix, then route the result back through code-simplifier and code-reviewer as needed. Only mark the task done after the final reviewer returns `DONE`.
78. - **NEEDS_CONTEXT:** Provide the missing context and re-dispatch.
79. - **BLOCKED:** Follow the shared escalation rules.
80. 
81. Never ignore an escalation or rerun the same stuck attempt without changing context, scope, or model.
82. 
83. ## Tracking Discipline
84. 
85. - Treat stale docs as incomplete work.
86. - Reflect every task status change in the tracker, plan, and todo tracker.
87. 
88. ## Commit Override Behavior
89. 
90. Never commit. The human will review the changes and commit manually later.
91. 
92. ## Red Flags
93. 
94. - Not using a subagent for implementation tasks, fixes, simplifications, or code-review findings
95. - The manager performs repo discovery, pattern lookup, first-pass design, code changes, or verification when the task is clear enough to dispatch
96. - Marking a tracking item completed when the implementer, code-simplifier, and code-reviewer did not return `DONE`
97. - Marking a task done without updating the plan and todo tracker
98. 
99. ## Verification
100. 
101. - [ ] Each increment was tested with the right checks for its stack
102. - [ ] Relevant build, test, or manual verification is clean
103. - [ ] Tracking and docs reflect the final state
104. - [ ] All changes are uncommitted
105.

### 💬 Copilot

I’ve got the build guardrails; I’m checking the handoff template and model-selection guidance so the manager response matches the workflow exactly.

1. # Implement Task N: [task name]
2. 
3. You are implementing Task N: [task name]
4. 
5. ## Workflow
6. 
7. 1. Invoke the `addy-incremental-implementation`, `addy-test-driven-development`, and `addy-context-engineering` skills.
8. 2. Read the task and acceptance criteria.
9. 3. Load the minimum context yourself: code, tests, patterns, types, and commands.
10. 4. Form the first-pass approach from that context.
11. 5. Write a failing test for the expected behavior (RED).
12. 6. Implement the minimum change to pass it (GREEN).
13. 7. Infer the slice's surface and stack first, then run the matching tests, build checks, or manual verification instead of defaulting to generic frontend commands.
14. 8. Report back.
15. 
16. **NEVER** commit.
17. **If any step fails**, follow the `addy-debugging-and-error-recovery` skill.
18. 
19. ## Context Expectations
20. 
21. - Assume the manager gives you a lean handoff, not a pre-solved design.
22. - Read the relevant files and find patterns yourself.
23. - Do **not** ask for more context just because you have not explored the repo yet.
24. - Treat "run the relevant validations" as a selection task: choose the narrowest checks that match the files and stack in this slice.
25. - Use `NEEDS_CONTEXT` only for missing product decisions, missing constraints, or conflicting signals you cannot resolve from the codebase and task context.
26. 
27. ## Report Format
28. 
29. - **Status:** DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
30. - What you implemented (or what you attempted, if blocked)
31. - What you tested, the exact commands, and the results
32. - Files changed
33. - Any issues or concerns
34. 
35. **Status Determination**:
36. 
37. - Use DONE_WITH_CONCERNS if you completed the work but have doubts about correctness.
38. - Use BLOCKED if you cannot complete the task.
39. - Use NEEDS_CONTEXT if you need information that wasn't provided. Use it for genuinely missing requirements or unresolved conflicts, not routine discovery. Never silently produce work you're unsure about.
40.

### 💬 Copilot

The manager should **reject that `NEEDS_CONTEXT` and re-dispatch**. In this workflow, **ordinary repo exploration is the implementer’s job**, and the manager must **not** pre-read the repo, draft the solution, or hand over likely patches.

A manager response should look like this:

\> `NEEDS_CONTEXT` is not valid here. Repo exploration, pattern lookup, and first-pass design are part of the implementer role. I’m not going to read the repo or solve it for you up front.  
\>  
\> Proceed from this lean handoff:
\> - **Task:** [original task text]
\> - **Success criteria:** [acceptance criteria]
\> - **Constraints:** [known constraints / repo rules]
\> - **Validation:** [known validation commands]
\> - **File hints:** [only already-known files, if any]  
\>  
\> Read the relevant files and patterns yourself, choose the narrowest matching validation, and continue. Use `NEEDS_CONTEXT` only if you hit **missing requirements, missing constraints, or conflicting signals** you cannot resolve from the task, plan, and codebase.

If nothing is actually missing, the manager should **re-dispatch immediately**, typically with the **same model**, not escalate.
