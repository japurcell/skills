# Skills - Known Issues

Layer-specific quirks for skills. Cross-cutting issues live in `.agents/memory/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.

**Affected area:** `skills/*/SKILL.md`
**Description:** `python3 skills/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py` rejects `disable-model-invocation` frontmatter even when a skill needs to keep it.
**Workaround:** Preserve the key when a human has approved it; expect validation to fail until the validator supports it.
